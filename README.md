### Blit_2D_Pyramid

Task is to implement a program that takes any string of 0 and 1s of suitable length, lowest bit at the end on the command line, internally constructs the corresponding pyramid, prints the pyramid as a binary string on one line (so the first line is the same as the input), applies the rules, prints the resulting pyramid for each reduction and for each transformation as a binary string in one line, and loops until the pyramid is reduced to a single bit and you print eitjer a 0 or 1 on a single line.
